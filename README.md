[MIUI 11 and 12](https://www.reddit.com/r/Xiaomi/comments/dkdhl3/miui_11s_builtin_share_feature_doesnt_have_the/) lack a "Copy to clipboard" option in the system share sheet, which has been a big pet peeve of mine. So rather than waste time copying text to clipboard using workarounds, I did it building this app :p
